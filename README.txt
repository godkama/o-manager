o!manager Installation Notes:

We recommend installing the program to a USB Key. This way, you can carry your configurations around to other computers, aswell as having multiple configurations on your computer.

DO NOT SHARE OR LOSE YOUR USB KEY. The different configuration files contain your login information, and you should generally not give them around.

We are not held accountable for any accounts accessed wrongfully, and we do not keep your information.
