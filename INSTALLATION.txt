Congrats on installing o!manager. Here are a few tips:

- Upon first install, you should export your profile, since it will instantly create a backup and secure your settings and database !
- Make sure to export your profile every time you change your settings. This will update everything for your installation.
- If you want to delete a profile, just go to the program's directory and delete said profile's folder.

Have a nice time using o!manager !!!
